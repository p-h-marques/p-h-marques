## My Soft Skills

As for soft skills, I highly value a collaborative and organized work environment. Therefore, qualities such as communication, guidance, organization, planning, and prioritization are part of my daily routine. In previous experiences, I’ve always been responsible for communicating not only with peers but also with other departments like architecture, design, product, and sales, in order to understand and translate demands and challenges into technology deliverables. Additionally, I’ve consistently encouraged the sharing of both technical and business knowledge across the team and have ease in writing documentation and delivery specifications.
